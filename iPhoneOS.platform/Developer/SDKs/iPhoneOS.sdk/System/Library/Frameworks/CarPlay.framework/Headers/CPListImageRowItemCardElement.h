/**
 Initialize an element that is constituted of an image, boolean to entierely cover the element with the image, title, subtitle and a tint color.
 
 When providing an image, your app should provide a @c UIImage that is display-ready. If necessary for the image, provide
 light and dark styles by using an asset from your asset catalog, prepared with light and dark styles
 or by using @c UIImageAsset to combine two @c UIImage instances into a single image with
 both styles.
 
 UIImageAsset is used to combine multiple UIImages with different trait collections into a single UIImage.
 
 @note The expected image size is given by +[CPListImageRowItemCardElement maximumImageSize] or by +[CPListImageRowItemCardElement maximumFullHeightImageSize] if @c showImageFullHeight is true. Images provided will be resized to this size if necessary.

 @discussion @c title should be non-nil when @c showImageFullHeight is true.

 @discussion To properly size your images, your app should size them to the display scale of the car screen.
 See -[CPInterfaceController carTraitCollection].
 
 @param image The image associated to the element.
 @param showImageFullHeight Determines if the image should entierely cover the card
 @param title The title of the element.
 @param subtitle The subtitle of the element.
 @param tintColor The color used as background if @c showImageFullHeight is true, part of the gradient color at the bottom of the card otherwise.
