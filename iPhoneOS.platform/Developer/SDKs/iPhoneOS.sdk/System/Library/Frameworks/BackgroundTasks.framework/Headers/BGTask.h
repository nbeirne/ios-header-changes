/// ``BGTaskScheduler/registerForTaskWithIdentifier:usingQueue:launchHandler:``.

/// A handler called shortly before the task’s background time expires.
///
/// There is a limit to how long your app has to perform its background work, and your work may need to be interrupted
/// if system conditions change. Assign a handler to this property to cancel any ongoing tasks, perform any needed
/// cleanup, and then call setTaskCompletedWithSuccess: to signal completion to the system and allow your app to be
/// suspended. This property is cleared after it is called by the system or when ``BGTask/setTaskCompletedWithSuccess:``
/// is called. This is to mitigate the impact of a retain cycle created by referencing the BGTask instance inside this
/// block.
///
/// The handler may be called before the background process uses the full amount of its allocated time.
///
/// - Parameters:
///     - expirationHandler: The expiration handler takes no arguments and has no return value. Use the handler to
///     cancel any ongoing work and to do any required cleanup in as short a time as possible.
///
/// - Note: The manager sets the value `expirationHandler` to `nil` after the handler completes.
/// - Warning: Not setting an expiration handler results in the system marking your task as complete and unsuccessful instead of sending a warning.

///
/// Call this method as soon as the background work associated with this task is complete. The system provides your app
/// with a limited amount of time to finish the task. If you do not call setTaskCompletedWithSuccess: on the task, the
/// system continues to run in the background until all the available time is consumed, wasting battery power. The
/// system suspends the app as soon as all background tasks are complete.
///
/// - Parameters:
///     - success: A `Boolean` indicating if the task completed successfully or not. If the task was unsuccessful, you
///     may request the system to try again later by submitting a new task request to the scheduler before calling this
///     method.
///
/// - Important: If you don’t set an expiration handler, the system will mark your task as complete and unsuccessful
/// instead of sending a warning.
/// - Warning: Not calling ``BGTask/setTaskCompletedWithSuccess:`` before the time for the task expires may result in
/// the system killing your app.
