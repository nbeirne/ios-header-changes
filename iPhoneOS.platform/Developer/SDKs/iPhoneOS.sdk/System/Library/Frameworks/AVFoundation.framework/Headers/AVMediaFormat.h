/*
	Tagging of tracks of .mov and .m4v files with media characteristics

	Each track of .mov files and .m4v files (that is, files of type AVFileTypeQuickTimeMovie and AVFileTypeAppleM4V) can optionally carry one or more tagged media characteristics, each of which declares a purpose, a trait, or some other disinguishing property of the track's media.

	For example, a track containing audio that mixes original program content with additional narrative descriptions of visual action may be tagged with the media characteristic "public.accessibility.describes-video" in order to distinguish it from other audio tracks stored in the same file that do not contain additional narrative. 

	Each tagged media characteristic in .mov and .m4v files is stored in track userdata as a userdata item of type 'tagc' (represented as a FourCharCode) that consists of a standard atom header (size and type) followed by an array of US-ASCII characters (8-bit, high bit clear) comprising the value of the tag. The character array is not a C string; there is no terminating zero. The userdata item atom size is sum of the standard atom header size (8) and the size of the US-ASCII character array.

	AVFoundation clients can inspect the tagged media characteristics of a track as follows:

		NSArray *trackUserDataItems = [myAVAssetTrack metadataForFormat:AVMetadataFormatQuickTimeUserData];
		NSArray *trackTaggedMediaCharacteristics = [AVMetadataItem metadataItemsFromArray:trackUserDataItems withKey:AVMetadataQuickTimeUserDataKeyTaggedCharacteristic keySpace:AVMetadataKeySpaceQuickTimeUserData];

		for (AVMetadataItem *metadataItem in trackTaggedMediaCharacteristics) {
			NSString *thisTrackMediaCharacteristic = [metadataItem stringValue];
		}

	-[AVAssetTrack hasMediaCharacteristic:] can be used to determine whether a track has a particular media characteristic, whether the characteristic is inferred from its media type or format descriptions (e.g. AVMediaCharacteristicAudible, AVMediaCharacteristicContainsOnlyForcedSubtitles) or requires explicit tagging (e.g. AVMediaCharacteristicTranscribesSpokenDialogForAccessibility, AVMediaCharacteristicDescribesVideoForAccessibility). Note that explicit tagging can't be used to override inferences from tracks' media types or format descriptions; for example, -[AVAssetTrack hasMediaCharacteristic:AVMediaCharacteristicVisual] will return NO for any audio track, even if the track has been perversely tagged with the visual characteristic.

	Tagged media characteristics can be written to the QuickTime userdata of an output track associated with an AVAssetWriterInput as follows, provided that the outputFileType of the AVAssetWriter is either AVFileTypeQuickTimeMovie or AVFileTypeAppleM4V:

		AVMutableMetadataItem *myTaggedMediaCharacteristic = [[[AVMutableMetadataItem alloc] init] autorelease];

		[myTaggedMediaCharacteristic setKey:AVMetadataQuickTimeUserDataKeyTaggedCharacteristic];
		[myTaggedMediaCharacteristic setKeySpace:AVMetadataKeySpaceQuickTimeUserData];

		[myTaggedMediaCharacteristic setValue:aMeaningfulCharacteristicAsNSString];

		[myMutableArrayOfMetadata addObject:myTaggedMediaCharacteristic];

		[myAssetWriterInput setMetadata:myMutableArrayOfMetadata];
