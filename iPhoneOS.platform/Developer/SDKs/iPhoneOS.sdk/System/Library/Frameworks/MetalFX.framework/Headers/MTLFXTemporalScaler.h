/// The MetalFX temporal scaler increases the size of your input texture to a larger output texture. You can use the
/// scaler to upscale every frame of your app’s scene or rendering in real time. With a scaler, you can draw more
/// complicated scenes in less time by intentionally rendering to a lower resolution to save time before upscaling.
///
/// Create an ``MTLFXTemporalScaler`` instance by following these steps:
/// 1. Create and configure an ``MTLFXTemporalScalerDescriptor`` instance.
/// 2. Call the descriptor’s ``newTemporalScalerWithDevice:`` method.
///
/// Upscale a rendering by following these steps for every render pass:
/// 1. Set the temporal scaler’s ``colorTexture`` property to the input texture.
/// 2. Set the scaler’s ``inputContentWidth`` and ``inputContentHeight`` properties.
