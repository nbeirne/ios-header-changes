 If the input image to -featuresInImage: is the output of a CoreImage operation, it may improve performance to specify the same context that was used to operate on that image.

 The detector may do image processing in this context and if the image is on the GPU and the specified context is a GPU context this may avoid additional upload to / download from the GPU.
