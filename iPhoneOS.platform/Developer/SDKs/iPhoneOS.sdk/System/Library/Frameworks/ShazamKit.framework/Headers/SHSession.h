/// An object that matches a specific audio recording when a segment of that recording is part of captured sound in the Shazam catalog or your custom catalog.
///
/// Prepare to make matches by:
///
/// - Creating a session for the catalog that contains the reference signatures
/// - Adding your delegate that receives the match results
///
/// Search for a match in one of two ways:
///
/// - Generate a signature for the captured audio and call ``match(_:)``
/// - Call ``matchStreamingBuffer(_:at:)`` with a streaming audio buffer, and ShazamKit generates the signature for you
///
/// Searching the catalog is asynchronous. The session calls your delegate methods with the result.
///
/// Matching songs in Shazam music requires enabling your app to access the catalog. For more information on enabling your app, see [Enable ShazamKit for an App ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-services/shazamkit).

/// The code below shows searching for a match in the Shazam catalog using an existing audio buffer:
///
/// ```swift
///// Set up the session.
///let session = SHSession()
///
///// Create a signature from the captured audio buffer.
///let signatureGenerator = SHSignatureGenerator()
///try signatureGenerator.append(buffer, at: audioTime)
///let signature = signatureGenerator.signature()
///
///// Check for a match.
///let result = await session.result(from: signature)
///
///// Use the result.
///switch result {
///  case .match(let match):
///       // Match found.
///  case .noMatch(let signature):
///       // No match found.
///  case .error(let error, let signature):
///       // An error occurred.
