/// Adds an array of songs to the user's Shazam library.

/// > Important:
/// > You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:
/// >
/// > ```swift
/// > func add(_ mediaItems: [SHMediaItem]) async throws

/// > For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swift/calling-objective-c-apis-asynchronously>.

/// Saving a song to the user's Shazam library also saves the following media item properties and their associated values:
///
/// - ``SHMediaItemProperty/shazamID``
/// - ``SHMediaItemProperty/title``
/// - ``SHMediaItemProperty/subtitle``, or ``SHMediaItemProperty/artist`` if the subtitle is unavailable
///
/// > Note:
/// > Saving to the user's Shazam library works only for songs with a valid ``SHMediaItemProperty/shazamID``.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - mediaItems: An array of media items that represents the songs to add to the library.
///   - completionHandler: The system calls this completion block after adding the media items to the library.
///
///     This block takes the following parameters:
///
///     - term `error`: An error object if a problem occurs when adding any item; otherwise, `nil`.
