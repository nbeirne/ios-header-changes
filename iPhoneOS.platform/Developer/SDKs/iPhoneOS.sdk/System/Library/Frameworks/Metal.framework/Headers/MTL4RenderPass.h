/// Describes a render pass.
///
/// You use render pass descriptors to create instances of ``MTL4RenderCommandEncoder`` and encode draw
/// commands into instances of ``MTL4CommandBuffer``.
///
/// To create render command encoders, you typically call ``MTL4CommandBuffer/renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor:``.
/// The ``MTL4CommandBuffer/renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor:options:`` variant of this method allows you to specify
/// additional options to encode a render pass in parallel from multiple CPU cores by creating *suspending* and *resuming*
/// render passes.
