/**
 An object you use to check for the availability of the speech recognition service, and to initiate the speech recognition process.

 An ``SFSpeechRecognizer`` object is the central object for managing the speech recognizer process. Use this object to:

 - Request authorization to use speech recognition services.
 - Specify the language to use during the recognition process.
 - Initiate new speech recognition tasks.

 ### Set up speech recognition

 Each speech recognizer supports only one language, which you specify at creation time. The successful creation of a speech recognizer does not guarantee that speech recognition services are available. For some languages, the recognizer might require an Internet connection. Use the ``isAvailable`` property to find out if speech recognition services are available for the current language.

 To initiate the speech recognition process, do the following:

 1. Request authorization to use speech recognition. See <doc:asking-permission-to-use-speech-recognition>.
 2. Create an ``SFSpeechRecognizer`` object.
 3. Verify the availability of services using the ``isAvailable`` property of your speech recognizer object.
 4. Prepare your audio content.
 5. Create a recognition request objectâ€”an object that descends from ``SFSpeechRecognitionRequest``.
 6. Call the ``recognitionTask(with:delegate:)`` or ``recognitionTask(with:resultHandler:)`` method to begin the recognition process.

 The type of recognition request object you create depends on whether you are processing an existing audio file or an incoming stream of audio. For existing audio files, create a ``SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest`` object. For audio streams, create a ``SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest`` object.

 ### Create a great user experience for speech recognition

 Here are some tips to consider when adding speech recognition support to your app.

 - **Be prepared to handle failures caused by speech recognition limits.** Because speech recognition is a network-based service, limits are enforced so that the service can remain freely available to all apps. Individual devices may be limited in the number of recognitions that can be performed per day, and each app may be throttled globally based on the number of requests it makes per day. If a recognition request fails quickly (within a second or two of starting), check to see if the recognition service became unavailable. If it is, you may want to ask users to try again later.
 - **Plan for a one-minute limit on audio duration.** Speech recognition places a relatively high burden on battery life and network usage. To minimize this burden, the framework stops speech recognition tasks that last longer than one minute. This limit is similar to the one for keyboard-related dictation.
 - **Remind the user when your app is recording.** For example, display a visual indicator and play sounds at the beginning and end of speech recognition to help users understand that they're being actively recorded. You can also display speech as it is being recognized so that users understand what your app is doing and see any mistakes made during the recognition process.
 - **Do not perform speech recognition on private or sensitive information.** Some speech is not appropriate for recognition. Don't send passwords, health or financial data, and other sensitive speech for recognition.

 This method returns the locales for which speech recognition is supported. Support for a locale does not guarantee that speech recognition is currently possible for that locale.

If the speech recognizer is currently unable to process requests,   ``isAvailable`` returns `false`.

 Speech recognition supports the same locales that are supported by the keyboard's dictation feature. For a list of these locales, see [QuickType Keyboard: Dictation](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#quicktype-keyboard-dictation).

/**
 Asks the user to allow your app to perform speech recognition.

 Call this method before performing any other tasks associated with speech recognition. This method executes asynchronously, returning shortly after you call it. At some point later, the system calls the provided `handler` block with the results.

 When your app's authorization status is ``SFSpeechRecognizerAuthorizationStatus/notDetermined``, this method causes the system to prompt the user to grant or deny permission for your app to use speech recognition. The prompt includes the custom message you specify in the `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` key of your app's `Info.plist` file. The user's response is saved so that future calls to this method do not prompt the user again.

 > Important:
 > Your app's `Info.plist` file must contain the `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` key with a valid usage description. If this key is not present, your app will crash when you call this method.

 For more information about requesting authorization, see <doc:asking-permission-to-use-speech-recognition>.

 - Parameters:
   - handler: The block to execute when your app's authorization status is known. The status parameter of the block contains your app's authorization status. The system does not guarantee the execution of this block on your app's main dispatch queue.
