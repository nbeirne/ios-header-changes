@class SFTranscriptionSegment;

/**
 A textual representation of the specified speech in its entirety, as recognized by the speech recognizer.

 Use `SFTranscription` to obtain all the recognized utterances from your audio content. An _utterance_ is a vocalized word or group of words that represent a single meaning to the speech recognizer (``SFSpeechRecognizer``).

 Use the ``formattedString`` property to retrieve the entire transcription of utterances, or use the ``segments`` property to retrieve an individual utterance (``SFTranscriptionSegment``).

 You don't create an `SFTranscription` directly. Instead, you retrieve it from an ``SFSpeechRecognitionResult`` instance. The speech recognizer sends a speech recognition result to your app in one of two ways, depending on how your app started a speech recognition task.

 You can start a speech recognition task by using the speech recognizer's ``SFSpeechRecognizer/recognitionTask(with:resultHandler:)`` method. When the task is complete, the speech recognizer sends an ``SFSpeechRecognitionResult`` instance to your `resultHandler` closure. Alternatively, you can use the speech recognizer's ``SFSpeechRecognizer/recognitionTask(with:delegate:)`` method to start a speech recognition task. When the task is complete, the speech recognizer uses your ``SFSpeechRecognitionTaskDelegate`` to send an ``SFSpeechRecognitionResult`` by using the delegate's ``SFSpeechRecognitionTaskDelegate/speechRecognitionTask(_:didFinishRecognition:)`` method.

 An `SFTranscription` represents only a potential version of the speech. It might not be an accurate representation of the utterances.
